To cite the sjemea package in publications, for now please cite the following paper:

@ARTICLE{Demas2003,
  title       = "Developmental loss of synchronous spontaneous activity in the
                 mouse retina is independent of visual experience",
  author      = "Demas, Jay and Eglen, Stephen J and Wong, Rachel O L",
  journal     = "J. Neurosci.",
  volume      =  23,
  issue       =  7,
  pages       = "2851--2860",
}

As of September 2013 I am working on a "data paper" describing some
MEA data and this package.  Once that paper is published, it will
become the paper to cite.
